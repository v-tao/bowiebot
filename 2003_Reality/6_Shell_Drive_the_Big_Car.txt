She waited by the moon
She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this
Of course she never showed
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Melted home through the snow
North along Riverside

She slips beneath the sheets
A husband's quiet devoted wife
But strangers, sad and nervous
By the dawn's early light
Love lies like a dead cloud
On a shabby, yellow lawn
Up on Riverside

She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson yeah
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now
I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson, yeah
(I'll bring you there)
And she'll drive the big car
And talk herself insane
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
Just a little bit angry now
(I'll bring you there)

Way back when millennium
Meant racing to the light
He promised her a dream-life
He'd take her back to street-life
Away from violent water
With its cormorants and leaves
Up on Riverside

She'll drive the big car
But he'll sit behind
Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio way up high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul

Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now
I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
(Just a little bit faster now)
Just a little bit louder now
(Just a little bit louder now
I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit angry now
(Just a little bit angry now)
South along the Hudson, yeah
(I'll bring you there)
She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
(I'll bring you there)
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
Just a little bit faster now
(I'll bring you there)
Just a little bit faster now
