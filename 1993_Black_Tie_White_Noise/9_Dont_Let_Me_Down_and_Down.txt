Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide

I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

I know there's something in the wind
That crazy balance of my mind
What kind of fool are you and I?
Scared to death and tell me why

I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

Still I keep my love for you

You made a date with destiny
You jog-jog in my memory
You haunt in mind not fade away

I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you

Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide

I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

Still I keep my love for you
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
No place to hide no way to fall
Still I keep my love for you
Still I keep my love for you
