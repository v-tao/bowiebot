He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle

And I'm gone, gone, gone
(Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality)
Now I'm older than movies
(Dance my way, falling up through the years)
Let me dance away
(Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
Now I'm wiser than dreams
(Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone)
Let me fly, fly, fly
(Spin slack through reality)
While I'm touching tomorrow
(Dance my way, falling up through the years)
And I know who's there
(Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
(Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone)
When silhouettes fall
(Spinning slack through reality)

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

Three old men dancing under her lamp lights
Shaking their sex in the bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked, anew
Like a bad tempered child
On the rain slicked streets

And I'm gone, gone, gone
(Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality)
Now I'm older than movies
(Dance my way, falling up through the years)
Let me dance away
(Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
Now I'm wiser than dreams
(Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone)
Let me fly, fly, fly
(Spin slack through reality)
While I'm touching tomorrow
(Dance my way, falling up through the years)
And I know who's there
(Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
(Losing breath underwater when I'm gone, gone, gone)
When silhouettes fall
(Spinning slack through reality)

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking

And I'm gone, gone, gone
(Gone, gone, gone spinning slack through reality)
(Dance my way, falling up through the years)
Let me dance, dance, dance
(Until I swivel back round then I fly, fly, fly)
And I'm gone
(Losing breath underwater well I'm gone, gone, gone)
Let me dance, dance, dance

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past
And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone through the crack in the past

Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
