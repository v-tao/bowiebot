My studies include exophagy
I formed my own society
To crush the power of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me, your messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not infertible
The crops are few, the cattle gone
There's only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me, your messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

Achtung, Achtung, these are your orders
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air will be slaughtered and cremated
One only cubic foot of air is allowed

I have prepared a document legalising mass abortion
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

You don't seem to hear me clear
Do I talk about your sphere?
Let me explain my project dear
Show you how I'll save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me, your messiah

We are not your friends
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to live our lives

We are hungry men
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to eat you
