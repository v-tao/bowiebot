Don't look down
They're making sort of crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield

But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name

But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear

But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake

But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
