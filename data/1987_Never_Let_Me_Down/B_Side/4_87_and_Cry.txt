It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May-Day
'87 and cry
'87 and cry

And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind (no)
And only you rocket on through the sky

Well, it couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and cry
'87 and cry

When the days were the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the biggy guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hanging on the enemy

And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream
And only you race on to wonder where

Well, it couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and cry
'87 and cry

You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy

Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murders on the heels of love
Just the ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret

Baby these were the sounds
Baby these were the sounds (yeah)
And only you whisper these things aren't true

Well, it couldn't be done without dogs
Well, it couldn't be once without us
'87 and cry
'87 and cry

'87 and cry
'87 and cry (cry, cry)
'87 and cry
'87 and cry (cry, cry)
'87 and cry
'87 and cry (cry, cry, cry, cry)
'87 and cry
'87 and cry (cry, cry, cry, cry)
'87 and cry
'87 and cry (cry, cry, cry, cry)
'87 and cry
'87 and cry (cry, cry, cry, cry)
'87 and cry
Hey
Hey
'87 and cry
