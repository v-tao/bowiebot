Here it is
Hey

Do you see that thing (that thing)
I'm sure it's love (it's love)
Would you do one thing
New York's in love
The city grew wings
In the back of the night
The clouds are stuck
Like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash
Having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from
There's nothing you can do to her
This city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher

New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks (t-t-talks, t-t-talks)
And the way she walks
New York's in love
Goo goo goo goo goo goo

My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat
No-one knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the Go-Go Boys
You're turned to stone by the family
It's now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here
But a raging blaze
I don't mean to wait too long

New York's in love
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks (walk that walk)
New York's in love
Goo goo goo goo goo goo

Pretty as a picture
New York, New York
Ugly on each side
New York's in love
New York's in love
New York's in flames
New York's in love
New York, New York
