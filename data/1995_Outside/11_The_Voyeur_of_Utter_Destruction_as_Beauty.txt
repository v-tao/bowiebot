Turn and turn again
Turn and turn again

I shake
And stare at the sun
'Til my eyes burn
I shake
At the mothers brutal vermin
I shake
And stare at the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober Philistine
And I shake

Turn and turn again
Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again

The screw
Is a tightening atrocity
I shake
For the reeking flesh is as romantic as hell
The need
To have seen it all
The voyeur of utter destruction
As beauty

I shake
Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again
I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake
I shake
I shake

Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day
Call it a day
Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
