Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes
Shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee

Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky
And a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to
No room for me
No fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the golden ones

Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh you pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh you pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way
For the homo superior

Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race

The earth is a bitch we've finished our news
Homo sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh you pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh you pretty things
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain
Gotta make way
For the homo superior
