(We're living in the golden, in the golden age)
(We're living in the golden age, the golden age)

Stomping along
On this big Philip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a job
When you know
You know the money's from day to day

All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams
In my mind's eye
All the joy I see
Through these architect's eyes

(We're living in the golden, in the golden age)
(We're living in the golden age, the golden age)

Cold winter bleeds
On the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Philip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scum holes
This goddamned starving life

All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams
In my mind's eye
All the joy I see
Through these architect's eyes

(We're living in the golden, in the golden age)
(We're living in the golden age, the golden age)

It's difficult you see
It's difficult you see

All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams
In my mind's eye
All the joy I see
Through these architect's eyes
