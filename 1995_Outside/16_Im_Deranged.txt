Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe
If I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me, babe
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond
No return, no return
I'm deranged
Deranged, down, down, down
I'm deranged, down, down, down
So cruise me, babe; cruise me, baby

And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me; cruise me; cruise me, babe

The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged

And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe

I'm deranged

And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
