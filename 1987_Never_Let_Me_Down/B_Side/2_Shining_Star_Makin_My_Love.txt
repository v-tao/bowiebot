Eddie boy lit like paraffin
Spending two weeks
In a crack house
Burns on his brain
Like Chernobyl
Dean was seen
With a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone to pray for
Until I met you

Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swinging door
I could be your great misfortune
I can make you happy
Every day of your life

Making my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice
Because love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice
I've touched down with vermin
Cowardice, lice
And I say
Nobody cares what you do
Please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man

Making my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far

Peter met Frank
Formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads out of shape for the name of Trotsky, Sinn-Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover the page
With debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs
Threw it all away
Another life in the grave (a life in the grave)

Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swinging door
I could be your great misfortune
Well, I could make you happy
Every goddamn single day of your life

Making my love
Like a shining star
Like a shining star
If that's what you are
Like a shining star (oh)
Making my love (making my love)
Like a shining star (like a shining star)
Taking my love (taking my love)
Just a touch too far (just a touch to far)
Making my love (making my making my making my love)
Like a shining star (like a shining star)
Taking my love (making my love)
Just a touch too far (just a touch to, uh far)
Making my love (making my love)
Like a shining star (huh, like a shining star)
Taking my love (taking my love)
Just a touch too far (touch to, uh, far)
Making my love (mm)
Like a shining star (hmm)
Taking my love (hmm)
