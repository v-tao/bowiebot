Said you took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh, so quietly
They say

Shoulda took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame
Something cheap
For you

Everyone says "Hi"

Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing
To say

I'd love to get a letter
Like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good
And it's not too hot
For you

Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says
Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says "Hi"

If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do the old things
We can do all the bad things
If the food gets you leery
You can always phone
We could do all the good things
We could do it, we could do it
We could do it

Don't stay in a bad place
Where they don't care how you are

Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says "Hi"
And the girl next door
And the guy upstairs
Everyone says "Hi"
And your mum and dad
Everyone says "Hi"
And your big fat dog
Everyone says "Hi"
Everyone says "Hi"
Hi hi hi hi
