Well, don't you worry 'bout what's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry, I can take my time
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm h-h-h-high

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just can't apologise, no
Don't hang me up but don't let me down
We could have fun just by grooving around
And around and around

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

Oh, you know I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
I'm just deciding baby

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

This doesn't happen to me every day
No excuses I've got anyway, hey
I'll satisfy your every need
And I know you'll satisfy me, oh my-my-my, my-my

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together

They said we were too young
Our kind of love was no fun
But our love comes from above
Do it!
Let's make love
Hoo!

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now!
